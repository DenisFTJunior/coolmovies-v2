> ## Tecnology

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Build Framework)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) (Component Library)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) (State Management)
- [Redux-Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) (State Side-effect Middleware)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) (GraphQL Query Client)
- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) (A practical functional library for JavaScript programmers.)

> ## Paradigm and design

- DDD (Design driven development)
- OO (Object Oriented)
- FP (Functional Programing)

### Folders

- Repositories (any connection with backend is where)
- Entities (the entities of the system. Ex.: Review)
- Components (some visual stuff who was businnes role for specific page or its reusable)
- Services (Logical and handlers)
- Test (jest tests)
- Pages (next pages)

Notes

- Mixed FP with OO in componets because its more interesting in some cases use OO or FP
- The design is a challange for me, I never utilised DDD until

> ## Challanges

- The principal challenge is mix REDUX-OBSERVABLE in my work
- Because the redux-observable I be not permited to use hooks to fetch data so the proccess change to a more complex solution
- Test is my weakness but I study and learn a lot, but I've more and more to learn, if you have any tip I thank

> ## Issues

- This one thing a can't fix, in the first load of next the component don't actualize even though the state change, if follow the flow of page the bug only occurs in the landing Page


> ## Final notes
- Your enterprise is incrible and your mission is passionate 
- I appreciate this opportunity and thanks you for review!
- If possible send me the problems with the code because I want to improve and be better!
